            <h1>What I changed</h1>
            <p>
              I changed the layout of the design in a few areas as well as
              adding a contact form using javascript. Created a wordpress
              website where i could add more posts to the website or have a
              store.

          <div class="projects-display">
            <h1>How I changed it</h1>
            <p>
              I changed this adding the javascript experience ive had in the
              first year a Noroff, where we created a contact form and adding
              simple form validation. I also made a wordpress host, where i
              could add more to the website without having to code it everytime,
              using wordpress REST API.
            </p>

          <div class="projects-display">
            <h1>Why I changed what I did</h1>
            <p>
              As i didnt get any feeback on this project, i didnt really know
              what parts i had to change, so i tried mixing up the design a bit,
              so it didnt look the same everywhere. And with the contact form it
              was just a way of showing that i have learned to create forms with
              js validation.
