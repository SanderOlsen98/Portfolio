        <h1>Cosmology</h1>
        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
            'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what 
            we can see and know about the universe around us. 
            Weâ€™ll locate the various constellations and galaxies 
            that can be seen and learn a bit about the early 
            navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
            <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: 
                from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope,
                to the latest exploration of the planets in our 
                solar system.</p>

        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. 
            Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his 
            theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place 
            in this world.</p>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved 
                our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didnt survive, 
                including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

        <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved 
            our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didnt survive, 
            including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore 
                the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery 
                of penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from 
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

        <h1>Ecology</h1>
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important 
            it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans
            but for the whole planet.</p>
            <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including 
                global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive 
                ways we can all contribute to a brighter future. </p>
