            <h1>What I changed</h1>
            <p>
              For the cross course project i had some difficulties getting the
              shopping cart to work. But i now managed to get the cart to show
              number of items in cart, and for the items to show up in the
              checkout page. I also took in consideration of the feeback i got
              from the project, where i changed to color of the signup button
              when you hover it.
            </p>

          <div class="projects-display">
            <h1>How I changed it</h1>
            <p>
              In order to get the shopping cart to work, i had to do some
              reasearch since it was quite complicated, but I managed to learn a
              lot from it. With the colors i changed i used adobe color to
              figure out what suited best for the website.
            </p>

          <div class="projects-display">
            <h1>Why I changed what I did</h1>
            <p>
              The reason i changed what i did was because i felt like i needed
              to get the shopping cart working and figuring out how to build
              that. And for the colors, i changed them because of the feeback i
              got from the project.
